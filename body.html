  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>I have a Computer Engineering degree from Kansas State
  University. After college, I worked briefly as a software engineer at
  Garmin, but never got my career on track. My last job, at Allen Press,
  provided many informal opportunities to revisit software development,
  and I'm now looking for a job in that field.

  <p>At Allen Press, I relearned XSLT, HTML, JavaScript, and the tools
  required to work productively in a Linux shell. Most recently, (in
  my free time) I've done some web development and created a terminal
  color palette adjuster in Go.
